I"<p>On June 7th, I was doing a product launch livestream. This was a huge event for me and one I’m still very proud of. I’ve been doing technical speaking and development on serverless architectures for a few years so the opportunity to join a cloud provider launching its first Functions as a Service product was a huge experience for me and one that was very much my jam. Months of prep work and I was at the start of a glut of activities. This livestream was just the first. Half-way through, I started to feel winded.</p>
