What do you really need those bells for? Are you trying to add an extension on your home or get a five star island? How will what you buy help? How do you plan to get those bells?</p>

<p>One of the ways to make bells is the selling of fruits and turnips. Fruits are an abundant sellable resource that requires space on your island (infrastructure) and a friend’s island to sell (connections). The return rate is steady but not time blocked. Turnips appear once a week with ten selling windows a week that can vary wildly on price where taking a loss is pretty common.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I’ll demonstrate how spend can tell us what our priorities were and the pros and cons to each approach. Cost management is more than cutting costs, but making sure the costs that are made support those priorities.</p>

It’s me! I’m back and updating again. I’ll be honest, I don’t feel like giving a whole update on where I’ve been. Short version is that the Pandemic happened, is still happening, and it’s no different than everyone else. What is important however is that I had the opportunity to take stock of what frustrated me about my work and make a conscious decision to focus on the things I truly wanted to do. This is just a blurb, but I’ll get into it as tie goes on.</p>

This is done by spinning up containers to run these functions on demand. For many use cases, this would be enough. Other times, you would need to manage small configurations such as time outs and memory. More often, a developer needs to use third-party libraries or a company built and maintained library.
